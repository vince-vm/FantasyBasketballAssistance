## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/AIFantasyBasketball
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If it doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to the URL shown in your terminal

## üìö ESPN API Integration

This app uses the community-discovered ESPN API endpoints documented in the [Public-ESPN-API repository](https://github.com/pseudo-r/Public-ESPN-API). The implementation tries multiple approaches:

1. **Fantasy API**: `https://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/fba/seasons/{season}/segments/0/leagues/standard`
2. **Sports Core API**: `https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/basketball/leagues/nba/seasons/{season}/athletes`
3. **Athletes with Stats**: `https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/basketball/leagues/nba/seasons/{season}/athletes?statistics=true`

### Important Notes About ESPN API

‚ö†Ô∏è **The ESPN API is unofficial and undocumented**. ESPN does not provide official support for these endpoints. Key considerations:

- **Instability**: Endpoints may change or be removed without notice
- **No SLA**: No service level agreements or official support
- **Terms of Service**: Usage may violate ESPN's ToS
- **Rate Limiting**: Unknown rate limits may apply

The app includes robust error handling and falls back to sample data when the API is unavailable.

### Testing ESPN API Endpoints

To test the ESPN API endpoints directly, run the example script:

```bash
python3 espn_api_example.py
```

This script demonstrates:
- Fetching NBA players from Sports Core API
- Getting players with statistics
- Accessing fantasy basketball data
- Retrieving team information
- Getting individual player statistics

## üìñ How to Use

### 1. Load Player Data
- Click "üîÑ Refresh Player Data" in the sidebar to fetch live NBA statistics
- Wait for the data to load (this may take a few seconds)

## üîß Customization

### Scoring System
To modify the scoring system, edit the `_calculate_fantasy_points()` method in `api_utils.py`:

```python
df['FPPG'] = (
    df['PTS_PG'] * 1.0 +      # Points multiplier
    df['REB_PG'] * 1.2 +      # Rebounds multiplier
    df['AST_PG'] * 1.5 +      # Assists multiplier
    df['STL_PG'] * 3.0 +      # Steals multiplier
    df['BLK_PG'] * 3.0 +      # Blocks multiplier
    df['TO_PG'] * -1.0        # Turnovers multiplier
).round(2)
```

### Data Columns
Add or remove columns by modifying the `display_cols` options in `app.py`.

### Styling
Customize the appearance by modifying the CSS in the `st.markdown()` section of `app.py`.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No player data found"**
   - The ESPN API might be temporarily unavailable
   - Try refreshing the data after a few minutes
   - Check your internet connection

2. **Slow loading**
   - The ESPN API can be slow during peak times
   - Consider running the app during off-peak hours
   - The first load is typically slower than subsequent refreshes

3. **Missing players**
   - Some players might not appear if they haven't played enough games
   - Players with 0 games played are filtered out
   - Check if the player is on a different team or injured

### Error Messages
- **API request failed**: Network or ESPN API issue
- **No valid player data extracted**: Data format changed or API unavailable
- **Unexpected error**: Check the terminal for detailed error messages
